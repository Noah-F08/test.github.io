### 1. Be a Responsible Consumer

<div align="justify"> 
 
Overfishing is one of the main causes of shark population decline. By choosing sustainably caught seafood (look for labels like **MSC** or **ASC**) and avoiding shark products, you help reduce demand for destructive fishing practices.
</div>

> **Tip:** Avoid purchasing products made from shark cartilage, liver oil (squalene), or fins.  
> These are often found in cosmetics, health supplements, or soups.

### 2. Reduce Plastic Pollution

<div align="justify">
Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in the ocean, killing countless marine animals, including sharks. Reducing your plastic use is one of the easiest and most impactful ways to help.

**Actions you can take:**
- Use reusable bags, bottles, and utensils.  
- Choose products with minimal or recyclable packaging.  
- Participate in local clean-up initiatives.

### 3. Spread Awareness

<div align="justify">
Misinformation is one of sharks’ biggest enemies. Sharing verified facts helps change public perception and encourages others to care.  
You can post educational content, talk about conservation efforts, or simply correct misconceptions when you hear them.
