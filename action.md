## 1. Be a Responsible Consumer

<p align="justify">
Overfishing is one of the main causes of shark population decline. By choosing sustainably caught seafood (look for labels like **MSC** or **Friends of the Sea**) and avoiding shark products, you help reduce demand for destructive fishing practices.

> **Tip:** Avoid purchasing products made from shark cartilage, liver oil (squalene), or fins.  
> These are often found in cosmetics, health supplements, or soups.
